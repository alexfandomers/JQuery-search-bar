A search box, search field, or search bar is a graphical element present in computer programs, such as file managers or web browsers, and on websites.
It works as the field for a query input or searches term from the user to search and retrieve related data from the database.
In this project, at first, on the webpage, there is only a Search Icon or Search Button but when you click on that button then the webpage screen
fills with gradient background color and show the search input field with smooth expanding animation at the center of the webpage. 
There are also shown the search icon for the search and cancel button to cancel that search page.

This search field is created only for design purposes so this program wonâ€™t retrieve any data or information when you entered some information and search
